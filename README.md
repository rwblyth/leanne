Reading material to check out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps
Read the sections "JavaScript first steps" and "JavaScript building blocks" (but you can ignore the bit about events)

Do the exercises if you can, give me a shout for help obvs if you need.

Take the scripts.js file and change it to do these things:

1. Tell someone to fuck off using an `if..else` statement
2. Make a variable called `yourName` to hold the name you type in
3. Make a variable called `greetingText` to hold the greeting, and use `greetingText` when you write to the web page
4. Use `else if` to add more people
5. Make it say "Yaya Yaya Yaya Yaya Yaya Yaya Yaya Toure" when you type your name as yaya
6. Use a `for` loop to build up the greetingText string with all the Yayas
7. Make an array with the cabinet in there
8. Use `includes()` to say something if the name is in the array
9. Use a `for` loop to print out all the names in the array
